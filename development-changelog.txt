Changes made: -Imported main GUI from older rendition of this program
               ("MainWindow" class)
              -Created "Tech" class
              -Created "TechManager" class. Contains a list that holds the
               current techs. Handles adding/removing/updating techs. Creates
               DefaultListModels which are used for updating in/out lists.
              -New techs are created via the "Create New Tech Wizard," launched
               by typing a new ID number into the text field and clicking "Time
               Stamp!". There is also a launcher in the menu bar.
              -Existing techs are either logged in or logged out (determined by
               a boolean value in the "Tech" class) when their IDs are typed
               into the text field and "Time Stamp!" is clicked.
              -Created a custom ListCellRenderer ("TechCellRenderer" class) to
               allow for greater manipulation of what shows up in the in/out
               lists.
              -Created "XMLWritable" interface. Used to obtain XML data from
               objects whose data is to be stored in an XML file.
              -Tech data is stored in XML format.
              -The clock now works.
              -Wrote javadocs for classes and public and some private methods.
