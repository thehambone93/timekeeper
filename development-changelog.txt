     Started: 24 July 2014
    Built by: Wes Hampson
  Build date: 11 August 2014
Build number: 29
Changes made: -Options > Exit now works
              -Program executes shutdown hook before exiting. Hook performs
			   tasks such as stopping the time thread.
              -Created "SettingsDialog" class (JDialog)
              -Created "SettingsManager" class
			  -Settings now save to "settings.xml"
              -Options > Settings... to access settings dialog
              -Signouts now save to "signoutData.xml"
              -Signout table now works, techs can add and remove signouts.
              -Added several filters to the signout table. A bug exists where
               signouts from the previous/next year will not be shown if the
               "show last/next week only" filter is selected and the signout
               week contains the last days of December and first days of
               January.
              -Added command-line option "--debug" which enables a "Debug"
               menu in the menu bar. This menu contains items for performing
               various tasks such as manually load and save data and start/stop
               the clock.
              -Signout table filter settings does NOT save in settings.xml yet.
              -Settings, tech data, and signout data all load at startup and
               save at shutdown.

Build number: 22
Changes made: -Imported main GUI from older rendition of this program
               ("MainWindow" class)
              -Created "Tech" class
              -Created "TechManager" class. Contains a list that holds the
               current techs. Handles adding/removing/updating techs. Creates
               DefaultListModels which are used for updating in/out lists.
              -New techs are created via the "Create New Tech Wizard," launched
               by typing a new ID number into the text field and clicking "Time
               Stamp!". There is also a launcher in the menu bar.
              -Existing techs are either logged in or logged out (determined by
               a boolean value in the "Tech" class) when their IDs are typed
               into the text field and "Time Stamp!" is clicked.
              -Created a custom ListCellRenderer ("TechCellRenderer" class) to
               allow for greater manipulation of what shows up in the in/out
               lists.
              -Created "XMLWritable" interface. Used to obtain XML data from
               objects whose data is to be stored in an XML file.
              -Tech data is stored in XML format.
              -The clock now works.
              -Wrote javadocs for classes and public and some private methods.
