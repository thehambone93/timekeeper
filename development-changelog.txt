Changes made: -Logging is now done through
               "weshampson.commonutils.logging.Logger".
              -Added a "Show Log" option to the "Options" menu. This opens the
               program log in a separate window. A menu bar is present in the
               log window and allows the user to export the log to a file, copy
               the log to the system's clipboard, or clear the log.
              -Settings now save when the settings dialog is closed
              -Added a setting for activity log folder.
              -Configuration is now saved in the ./data/ directory by default.
              -When time reaches midnight, new date is printed to the command
               line (for easier debugging).
              -Removed "updateTech" method from TechManager as it is not
               necessary.
              -Signout filter selection now saves after the program is closed.
              -Tech lists can now be sorted. Sort options are saved after the
               program is closed.
              -Added an activity logger. Logs to a file when techs sign in/out,
               signouts are added/removed/executed, a tech is created/removed,
               or a tech is marked/unmarked as an admin.
              -Re-did the clock. The clock has been moved into its own class.
              -The loading of techs no longer stops when a duplicate ID is
               encountered.
              -Program now stores the locations of data files using relative
               paths.
              -Added a "Tech Not Found" exception
              -Added a "Sign Out" option to the Options menu
              -Counters now update appropriately
              -"Show All Counters" link now opens a dialog showing all counters
              -System now knows when a tech is signed out; techs can't add
               multiple signouts for a single day.
              -Added a "Show Tech Info" option to the tech list right-click
               menus
              -In the settings dialog, the "Signouts" panel is now broken into
               "Admin Approval" and "Late Signouts"
              -Created an admin manager. Allows user to mark/unmark techs as
               admins
              -Admins can now approve signout entries.

  Build date: 11 August 2014
Build number: 29
Changes made: -Options > Exit now works
              -Program executes shutdown hook before exiting. Hook performs
			   tasks such as stopping the time thread.
              -Created "SettingsDialog" class (JDialog)
              -Created "SettingsManager" class
			  -Settings now save to "settings.xml"
              -Options > Settings... to access settings dialog
              -Signouts now save to "signoutData.xml"
              -Signout table now works, techs can add and remove signouts.
              -Added several filters to the signout table. A bug exists where
               signouts from the previous/next year will not be shown if the
               "show last/next week only" filter is selected and the signout
               week contains the last days of December and first days of
               January.
              -Added command-line option "--debug" which enables a "Debug"
               menu in the menu bar. This menu contains items for performing
               various tasks such as manually load and save data and start/stop
               the clock.
              -Signout table filter settings does NOT save in settings.xml yet.
              -Settings, tech data, and signout data all load at startup and
               save at shutdown.

Changes made: -Imported main GUI from older rendition of this program
               ("MainWindow" class)
              -Created "Tech" class
              -Created "TechManager" class. Contains a list that holds the
               current techs. Handles adding/removing/updating techs. Creates
               DefaultListModels which are used for updating in/out lists.
              -New techs are created via the "Create New Tech Wizard," launched
               by typing a new ID number into the text field and clicking "Time
               Stamp!". There is also a launcher in the menu bar.
              -Existing techs are either logged in or logged out (determined by
               a boolean value in the "Tech" class) when their IDs are typed
               into the text field and "Time Stamp!" is clicked.
              -Created a custom ListCellRenderer ("TechCellRenderer" class) to
               allow for greater manipulation of what shows up in the in/out
               lists.
              -Created "XMLWritable" interface. Used to obtain XML data from
               objects whose data is to be stored in an XML file.
              -Tech data is stored in XML format.
              -The clock now works.
              -Wrote javadocs for classes and public and some private methods.
